# Advanced Filters Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent Filter Property Names**
- **Problem**: The `FilterCriteria` interface had duplicate/conflicting properties (e.g., `keywords` vs `keywordFilters`)
- **Solution**: Standardized property names in `FilterCriteria`:
  - `keywords` for keyword filtering
  - `channels` for channel inclusion
  - `excludeChannels` for channel exclusion
  - Removed duplicate `keywordFilters` and `channelFilters` properties

### 2. **Missing Filter Implementations in CompositeFilter**
- **Problem**: The `CompositeFilter.buildFilters()` method was not including all premium filters
- **Solution**: Added all filter types to `CompositeFilter`:
  - `KeywordFilter` (for keywords)
  - `ChannelIncludeFilter` (for channels)
  - `ChannelExcludeFilter` (for excludeChannels)
  - `DateFilter` (for uploadedAfter)
  - `ViewCountFilter` (for minViews/maxViews)

### 3. **Missing Video Metadata Extraction**
- **Problem**: YouTube adapter wasn't extracting view count and upload date
- **Solution**: Enhanced `YouTubeAdapter.extractMetadata()` to:
  - Parse view count from metadata line (handles K/M abbreviations)
  - Parse relative upload dates (e.g., "2 days ago", "1 week ago")
  - Added helper methods: `parseViewCount()`, `parseUploadDate()`, `parseRelativeDate()`

### 4. **Updated References Throughout Codebase**
- Updated `environment.ts` feature flags
- Updated `content/app.ts` to use new property names
- Updated `popup/index.ts` storage keys
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in YouTube adapter

## How Filters Work Now

### Filter Flow:
1. User sets filter criteria in `AdvancedFilterPanel`
2. Criteria is passed to `HeaderControls.updateCriteria()`
3. `FilterVideosUseCase` creates a `CompositeFilter` with the criteria
4. `CompositeFilter` builds individual filters based on criteria
5. Each video is tested against all active filters
6. Videos must pass ALL filters to be shown

### Available Filters:
- **Duration Filter**: Min/max duration (already working)
- **Keyword Filter**: Videos with keywords in title
- **Channel Include Filter**: Only show videos from specific channels
- **Channel Exclude Filter**: Hide videos from specific channels
- **Date Filter**: Only show videos uploaded after a date
- **View Count Filter**: Min/max view count range
