# DSA Compliance Opportunities for SmartStream Filter

## Executive Summary

SmartStream Filter positions itself as a Digital Services Act (DSA) Article 27 compliance solution, helping platforms avoid substantial regulatory fines while empowering users with control over recommendation algorithms.

## DSA Article 27 Relevance

SmartStream Filter supports platforms in fulfilling Digital Services Act (DSA) Article 27 by:

1. **User Control**: Providing customizable filters (e.g., video duration) that give users control over recommendation algorithms
2. **Reducing Manipulative Design**: Limiting "infinite scrolling" and promoting conscious time usage
3. **Transparency**: Clearly showing how user choices (e.g., "max 10 minutes") affect the content they see

## Financial Risk for Non-Compliance

Platforms that don't offer user control over recommendations risk fines up to **6% of global revenue**:

| Platform | 2023 Revenue | Potential Fine |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| YouTube (Google) | $307 billion | Up to $16 billion |
| Meta (Facebook/Instagram) | $134.9 billion | Up to $7 billion |
| TikTok | ~$75 billion | Up to $4.5 billion |
| Netflix | $33.7 billion | Up to $2 billion |
| Spotify | $13.2 billion | Up to $792 million |
